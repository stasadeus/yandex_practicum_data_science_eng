## Data
We have at our disposal historical data on sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms of computer games:  

- `Name` — game name  
- `Platform` — platform  
- `Year_of_Release` — release year  
- `Genre` — game genre  
- `NA_sales` - sales in North America (millions of copies sold)

- `JP_sales` - sales in Japan (millions of copies sold)  
- `Other_sales` - sales in other countries (millions of copies sold)  
- `Critic_Score` - score of critics (maximum 100)
