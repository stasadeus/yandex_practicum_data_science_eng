# Determining the age of buyers

## Task  
A chain supermarket introduces a computer vision system to process customer photos. Photo fixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:  

- Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group;  
- Control the conscientiousness of cashiers when selling alcohol.  

It is necessary to build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. Build and train a convolutional neural network on a dataset with photographs of people. Achieve the MAE value on the test sample no more than 8.

## Data
We have at our disposal a set of photographs of people with age indications.

## Used libraries
numpy, pandas, keras
